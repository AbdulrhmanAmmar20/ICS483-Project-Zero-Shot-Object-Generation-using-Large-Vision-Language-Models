# ICS483-Project-Zero-Shot-Object-Generation-using-Large-Vision-Language-Models
We’re reimplementing AnyDoor, a zero-shot diffusion model that “teleports” a chosen object into a new scene at a user-specified spot. It preserves identity (logos, textures, lighting) via a Detail Extractor. We’ll test robustness on “impossible” geometry placements and improve inference for user-captured photos.
